## Overview
### Description
Many people will run into a situation where they have to choose where to eat. FoodChoice aims to solve any potential conflicts by letting everyone have input on where to eat by swiping left and right on restaurant options depending on whether they have a taste for it or not.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Food / Utility
- **Mobile:** This app will be designed for mobile mainly, as it is intended to be used while users are out and about.
- **Story:** Aggregates food choices from all users, and finds the most agreed upon option between them. The users can then decide whether or not they want to go to the given restaurant or collect more data.
- **Market:** Anyone may use this app but it is mainly directed towards professionals and people who are social.
- **Habit:** This app will be used proportionally to how often users eat out.
- **Scope:** The initial intent is to use this app between established groups of friends, but it could possibly become an app where people share restaurant recommendations with people in their area.
